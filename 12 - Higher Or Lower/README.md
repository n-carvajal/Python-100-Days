## Project 12: Higher or Lower Game

Create a game where a player is asked to choose which of two instagram accounts has more or less followers.
If the player guesses correctly the correctly guessed account is now compared against a new account.
If the player guesses incorrectly the game ends.
For every correct guess inform the player of their streak.
