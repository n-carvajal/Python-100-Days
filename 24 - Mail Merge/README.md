## Project 24: Bulk Mailer

### Objective

* Open the template letter in `starting_letter.txt` found within the **/Input/Letters/** folder.
* Open the list of names in the `invited_names.txt` found within the **/Input/Names/** folder.
* Merge the two files together to produce a new file for every person in the list at `invited_names.txt`.
* Each file created should have a personalised name in the form of: `letter_to_{invited_person_name}.txt`.
* Each created file should be saved within the **/Output/ReadyToSend/** folder.
* Each file should contain a personalised greeting within it in the form of `Dear {invited_person_name},`.
* After the personalised greeting, each file should display the text from `starting_letter.txt`.
