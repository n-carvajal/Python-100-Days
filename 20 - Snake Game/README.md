## Project 20: Hungry Snake Game

Make a clone of the old 'Hungry Snake' game that used to be on Nokia phones.
Where the snake must eat the randomly generated food items without hitting a wall or
running into its own tail. With every food item eaten, the snake's body is extended.

The game can be made more difficult by adjusting the interval at which the snake speed increases.
