## Project 23: Turtle Crossing Game Clone

This is a clone of the Turtle Crossing Game where you have to safely navigate your character across the road
without colliding with the oncoming traffic.  Every time you make it safely across the road, the traffic starts moving a
little faster.

### Controls

The character can be controlled using the 'Up', 'Down', 'Left', and 'Right' arrow keys.

### Notes

To play the game run `main.py`.

The game speed can be manipulated within main.py by decreasing the value multiplying the `time_delay` in `line : 103`.
